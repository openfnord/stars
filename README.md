# Count GitHub Stars per Day ‚≠ê

Track GitHub stars per day over a date range to measure the open-source popularity of different repositories.

### Requirements

`PyGitHub` is required to access the [GitHub REST API] via Python. This library enables you to manage [GitHub] resources such as repositories, user profiles, and organizations in your Python applications.

[GitHub REST API]: https://docs.github.com/en/rest
[GitHub]: https://github.com

```bash
pip install PyGithub
```

### Usage

Update `TOKEN` to a valid [GitHub access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) in `count_stars.py` L15 and then run:

```python
python count_stars.py
```

### Result

When run on April 3rd, 2022 result is:
